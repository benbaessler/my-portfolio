            I am a 20-year-old German-American software engineer based in Germany, with a passion for building ideas from the ground up. I began teaching myself to code in 2019, driven by the desire to create and innovate. Over time, I have honed my skills in languages like Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Flutter, HTML/CSS, and Solidity, while exploring diverse areas of software engineering.

            From October 2022 to February 2023, I was a Software Engineer at
            Morpho Labs, working with technologies like DeFi, React, and
            TypeScript while gaining valuable experience working in a fast-paced
            start-up environment.

          <p>
            I am particularly passionate about onchain social applications and have built various projects on platforms like Lens Protocol and Farcaster.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I thrive in both autonomous and collaborative environments and am currently seeking a remote position, ideally as a front-end or full-stack engineer.

            always seeking new challenges and innovations in the web3 space,

            technology.
